Q1. 
Equation is
 
MEDV = -0.1084 * CRIM + 0.0458 * ZN + 2.7187 * CHAS=1 - 17.376 * NOX + 3.8016 * RM - 1.4927 * DIS + 0.2996 * RAD - 0.0118 * TAX - 0.9465 * PTRATIO + 0.0093 * B - 0.5226 * LSTAT + 36.3411

The output linear equation describes x,y relationship where x is a set of independent variables and y is a dependent variable. 

Here the independent variables includes CRIM, ZN, CHAS=1, NOX, RM, DIS, RAD, TAX, PTRATIO, B, LSTAT whereas the dependent variable is MEDV.

Coefficient of each independent variable represents its weight towards MEDV i.e for example PTRATIO contributes -0.9465 times to its weight to value of MEDV. 

Variables like INDUS, CHAS=0 and AGE attributes are missing as they might not statistically contribute much to the relationship.

The constant term 36.3411 is the y-intercept of regression line.  

So in total there are 12 terms in the equation which includes constant term.
